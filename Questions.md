# hoomd-blue Questions

## How-to
* In the python code, the CellCycle Checkpoints are checked at every timestep / In Hoomd I cannot do that
* We might be able to tweak the masses of the particles / particle types to avoid explosion / implosion of the system
* We definitely have a trade-off in self developed code from analogue systems to semi digital systems.
  * In the python2 code, the cells can have any size, compound secretion levels or so
  * In the hoomd system, it seems like we have to specify ditinct Types
